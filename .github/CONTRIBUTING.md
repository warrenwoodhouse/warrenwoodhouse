# How to Contribute

I love to accept your patches and contributions to my projects. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to my projects must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives me permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of my projects. Make sure to include your license in the folder where your contribution is made.

## Code reviews & project reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. I
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows the [Community Guidelines](https://warrenwoodhouse.blogspot.com/guidelines).
